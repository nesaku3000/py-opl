# py-opl

My OPL (own programming language) written in python. <br>
Made just for fun, with rewriting interpreter to c++ in mind. <br>

## Current features

- `out var` prints value of given variable, if variable does not exist, prints given text
- `set var exp` set value of variable to expression; if variable does not exist creates variable with value of expression; if value is not specified sets value to 0
- `if exp` if expression is equal to False, skips next line
- `jmp exp` jumps to line number equal to expression

## Upcoming features

- custom expression evaluation including variable defined values
- idk yet
